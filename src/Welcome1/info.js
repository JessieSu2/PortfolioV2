  "Gaming when I was younger is what got me into Computer Science. My dream job is to create games for future gamers to enjoy. Learning more about technology I found my interest in Frontend Development / UX & UI / Prototyping / Mobile Development / Full Stack / Gaming development. Having a background as a barista and working in retail I enjoy learning new skills and work well with a team.";
